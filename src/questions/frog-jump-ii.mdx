# Frog Jump II

## תיאור השאלה

Given an array representing stones' positions, determine the minimal maximum jump for the frog to reach the end.

## פיתרון

The optimal route skips every other stone, so the answer is the maximum gap between stones two positions apart (with the first jump handled separately).

```javascript
function maxJump(stones) {
  let answer = stones[1] - stones[0];
  for (let i = 2; i < stones.length; i++) {
    answer = Math.max(answer, stones[i] - stones[i - 2]);
  }
  return answer;
}
```

```python
from typing import List


def maxJump(stones: List[int]) -> int:
    answer = stones[1] - stones[0]
    for i in range(2, len(stones)):
        answer = max(answer, stones[i] - stones[i - 2])
    return answer
```
