# Unique Paths

## תיאור השאלה

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner. The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner. How many possible unique paths are there?

## פיתרון

Use a 1D dynamic programming array to accumulate paths column by column.

```javascript
function uniquePaths(m, n) {
  const dp = new Array(n).fill(1);
  for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
      dp[j] += dp[j - 1];
    }
  }
  return dp[n - 1];
}
```

```python
def uniquePaths(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    dp = [1] * n
    for _ in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
    return dp[-1]
```
